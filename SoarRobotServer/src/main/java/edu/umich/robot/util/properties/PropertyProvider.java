 * Provides storage and retrieval for a particular property in a

 * custom storage along with expanded constraints on the value of the property.
 *

 * It is expected that the implementation of the {@link #get()} and
 * {@link #set(Object)} methods will provide synchronization. That is, the
 * owning property manager's state is sufficiently guarded, but the property
 * provider is not protected by default.
